# Cars And Owners List

Node modules
There are two package.json files
One at the root of the project, and the second in the client folder
So we run this command twice
```
npm install
```

##MonoDB

Our data as a JSON documents will be kept on mLab: cloud hosted MongoDB server

## Build

Run `ng build` from client folder to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

##Server.js

From root of project run
```
nodemon
```
This will start the server on port 3000

And go to http://localhost:3000/
